            - Ansh Bhawnani has created a repository to guide those starting their careers in bug bounties. - A security bug is a weakness found in software or hardware elements that can negatively affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. - A bug bounty program is a reward program offered for uncovering and reporting a bug in a specific software product. - Rewards can range from real money to gift vouchers, depending on the severity of the issue and cost to fix. - To become a successful bug bounty hunter, one must learn key topics such as computer fundamentals, computer networking, operating systems, and programming. - Many resources are available to aid in this learning including books, writeups, blogs, articles, forums, official websites, and YouTube channels. - It is vital to practice through CTF (Capture the Flag) activities and using online and offline labs. - Bug bounty platforms such as Bugcrowd, Hackerone, and Intigriti can be used to crowdsource bounties, while individual programs are operated by companies like Facebook and Google. - The bug bounty report must have a clear title, description, steps to reproduce, proof of concept, and identified impact. - Additional tips include not relying solely on bug bounties for income, staying updated, seeing bug bounties as a way to enhance skills, staying connected to the community, always being helpful, and not being dependent on automation.
